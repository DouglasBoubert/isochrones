    "# Multiple star systems\n",

    "One of the signature capabilities of **isochrones** is the ability to fit multiple star systems to observational data.  This works by providing a `StarModel` with more detailed information about the observational data, and about how many stars you wish to fit.  There are several layers of potential intricacy here, which we will walk through in stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unresolved multiple systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Often it is of interest to know what potential binary star configurations are consistent with observations of a star.  For most stars the best available observational data is a combination of broadband magnitudes from various all-sky catalogs and parallax measurements from *Gaia*.  Let's first generate synthetic observations of such a star, and then see what we can recover with a binary or triple star model, and also what inference of this system under a single star model would tell us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note here that for this simplest of multiple star scenarios---unresolved, physically associated, binary or triple-star systems---there are special `StarModel` objects available that have more highly optimized likelihood calculations, analogous to the `SingleStarModel` that is available for a simple single-star fit.  `BinaryStarModel` and `TripleStarModel` are these special objects.  In order to accommodate more complex scenarios, such as fitting resolved steller companions, it is necessary to use the vanilla `StarModel` object. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will initialize the isochrone interpolator.  Note that we actually *require* the isochrone interpolator here, rather than the evolution track interpolator, because the model requires the primary and secondary components to have the same age, so that age must be a sampling paramter."

Each node named with a bandpass represents an observation, with some magnitude and uncertainty (at some separatrion and position angle---irrelevant for the unresolved case).  The model nodes here are named `0_0` and `0_1`, with the first index representing the system, and the second index the star number within that system.  All stars in the same system share the same age, metallicity, distance, and extinction.  In the computation of the likelihood, the apparent magnitude in each observed node is compared with a model-based magnitude that is computed from the *sum of the fluxes of all model nodes underneath that observed node in the tree*.  In the unresolved case, this is trivial, but this structure becomes important when a binary is resolved.
