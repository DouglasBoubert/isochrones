    "One of the signature capabilities of **isochrones** is the ability to fit multiple star systems to observational data.  This works by providing a `StarModel` with more detailed information about the observational data, and about how many stars you wish to fit.  There are several layers of potential intricacy here, which we will walk through in stages.\n",

    "## Unresolved multiple system\n",
    "\n",
    "Often it is of interest to know what potential binary star configurations are consistent with observations of a star.  For most stars the best available observational data is a combination of broadband magnitudes from various all-sky catalogs and parallax measurements from *Gaia*.  Let's first generate synthetic observations of such a star, and then see what we can recover with a binary star model, and also what inference under a single star model would tell us.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will initialize the isochrone interpolator.  Note that we actually *require* the isochrone interpolator here, rather than the evolution track interpolator, because the model requires the primary and secondary components to have the same age, so that age must be a sampling paramter."

    "Inspecting this tree to make sure it accurately represents the desired model becomes more important if the model is more complicated, but this simple case is a good example to review.  Each node named with a bandpass represents an observation, with some magnitude and uncertainty (at some separatrion and position angle---irrelevant for the unresolved case).  The model nodes here are named `0_0` and `0_1`, with the first index representing the system, and the second index the star number within that system.  All stars in the same system share the same age, metallicity, distance, and extinction.  In the computation of the likelihood, the apparent magnitude in each observed node is compared with a model-based magnitude that is computed from the *sum of the fluxes of all model nodes underneath that observed node in the tree*.  In the unresolved case, this is trivial, but this structure becomes important when a binary is resolved.  This model, because the two model stars share all attributes except mass, has the following parameters:"
